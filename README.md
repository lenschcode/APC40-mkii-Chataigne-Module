# APC40-mkII-Chataigne-Module
A Chataigne module for the Akai APC40-mkII MIDI Controller

## Current Features:
- All inputs mapped
- LED feedback for all pads and buttons
- RGB input for color pads (then matched to midi color pallette)
- Full feedback for encoders including different modes
- Resync function, restores last status after reconnecting

## Planned Features:
- Pulsing/blinking for non-color pads/buttons
- User-reset functions

## Known Bugs
- Resyncing the midi status of encoders and buttons happens after first user input (instant resync was unreliable)
